				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, I haven’t been very good about getting change log posts up, have I.  We’re still plugging away.  We have someone working on the stairs and that will be done on Monday.  Matt’s working on getting the kitchen together today and this weekend (after working on the oak flooring last weekend) and hopes to be done by the end of the weekend.  I’ve been doing some more painting and cleaning, but most of the week has been taken up with kids’ activities.  Tomorrow I hope to start installing the flooring we have for the bedrooms.  The boys’ room is almost for that.  I’m really looking forward to seeing that floor go down!  If you look at the <a href="/move-in-list/">move-in list</a>, you’ll see that we really are getting close…  We might even be in our house in August.  We shall see.  I’m not feeling particularly excited, because  it doesn’t really seem possible that we might be living there.  It has just been too long of a process.</p>

<p>We have hot water now!  Our propane tank is all hooked up and the hot water heater works.  This was particularly welcome because I spent part of the afternoon pulling up poison oak with my bare hands.  I was able to wash up with warm water rather than frigid, fresh from the well groundwater &#8211; a vast improvement.  And yes, I know, this was not so bright of me, but it seemed like a good idea at the time.  No rash so far, thankfully.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re really making some headway on our list these days!  Over the past week we did a lot of cleaning up and we got ready for our flooring installation today.  We also had the propane tank set today and our kitchen counters were delivered.</p>
<p>I installed plugs in Matt&#8217;s office and finally put a switch plate on the light switch in the storage area.  I finished up the electrical outlets outside.  I also finished painting the kids&#8217; bath, fixed some drywall in there, and did some painting in the master bath.  I started measuring the cabinets for knobs, but didn&#8217;t finish that yet. I spent a lot of time with the shop-vac and cleaned up a lot of dust and sawdust.</p>
<p>Matt installed the pedestal sink and faucet, nailed down the underlay in the upstairs bathroom, worked on the oak flooring upstairs, built a platform for the island future in the kitchen, and did a lot of picking up and putting tools and such away.</p>
<p>As you can see from the <a href="/move-in-list/">move-in checklist</a>, we&#8217;re making a lot of progress! This week we should be getting our appliances, our propane hooked-up, and possibly five more doors.  Once we have the appliances, Matt will be able to get those in place and then get the counters installed.  Yay!  </p>

<ul>
<li>I finished painting the sink area of the kids&#8217; bath and finished the walls in the shower area</li>
<li>I did lots of cleaning downstairs</li>
<li>Matt installed the sinks, faucets and drains for the kids&#8217; bath and master bath.  We now have four working sinks in the house.</li>
<li>Matt did more trim work for the windows in the open area, then disassembled the scaffolding and got that loaded on his dad&#8217;s truck.  It is really nice not having that scaffolding there anymore &#8211; although it certainly was useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>I updated the <a href="/move-in-list/">Move-In Checklist</a> and as you can see we&#8217;re slowly making progress.  Emphasis on the slowly part!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change Log for Friday, May 29th through Thursday, June 4th</p>
<p>I did a lot of cleaning up and organizing on Friday and through the weekend to prepare for having someone out to measure for our linoleum install.  I also bought paint and I am working on painting the kids&#8217; bath before the linoleum is laid down (currently scheduled for the 15th).  I&#8217;ve put down a deposit and ordered the rest of our appliances (range, hood and dishwasher) and our kitchen countertop.  I&#8217;ve ordered five more doors (pantry, utility door and pocket door, master bath, toilet area door for the kids&#8217; bath). I&#8217;ve picked out the flooring for the bedrooms upstairs and for the open area and away room downstairs. </p>
<p>Over the weekend Matt worked on some of the window trim, installed the venting grates for the freezer, hung the door for the kids&#8217; bath, and worked on the underlay for the kids&#8217; bath.  </p>
<p>We also had a plumber come out for the day on Tuesday and he installed all the shower hardware and the hot water heater.  We&#8217;re supposed to get our propane tank installed next week, so we should have hot water soon.</p>
<p>FYI &#8211; I updated the <a href="/move-in-list/">Move-In List</a>.</p>
