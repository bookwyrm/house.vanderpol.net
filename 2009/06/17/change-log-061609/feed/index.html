		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Amber, I can&#039;t believe you can pull up poison oak with your bare hands and not get a rash!  Although I recently did battle with poison ivy, and even though I know quite a bit of it brushed my arms above my gloves, I only got the tiniest pink spot, and it barely itches... so maybe some of us react less to these things than my Mom does. :)  She has a bad history with poison oak.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m reading it!!!! I guess my only question is why were you pulling up poison oak with your bare hands??&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so impressed with all you and Matt have done. You both should be very proud of everything you&#039;ve done! We&#039;re certainly very proud of you both!&lt;/p&gt;
