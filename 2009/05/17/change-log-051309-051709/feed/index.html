		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it&#039;s all coming together. It&#039;s slower going near the end, isn&#039;t it? I think you&#039;re at the point we were at when I told Zorak that it was actually quite tempting to just buy a case of liquid nails and bulk duct tape to finish up anything that still needed laying/nailing/setting. That&#039;s also the point at which he demoted me from supervising projects. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hang in there!!&lt;/p&gt;
