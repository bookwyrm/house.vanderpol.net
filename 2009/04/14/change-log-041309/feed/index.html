		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Amber - this is exactly the sink we have in our kitchen! I didn&#039;t think it was made anymore (we installed it over 15 years ago). It&#039;s one of my favorite additions. I never miss the divided sink. At the time we were remodeling, it was available at Home Depot, but I haven&#039;t seen it there for years.&lt;/p&gt;
