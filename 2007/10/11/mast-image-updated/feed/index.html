		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Comments were off due to an error when I posted the entry - they&#039;re back on now. I always like feedback and input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that while this bit has been (and I&#039;m sure will continue to be) difficult, we&#039;ll look back on it with fond memories and be very glad and happy with the home we have built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow! What fantastic progress!! I don&#039;t envy you the work on the batter boards in the previous post - but you&#039;ll sure be glad to have those 90&#039;s when the walls are going up. &lt;em&gt;grin&lt;/em&gt; I&#039;m so excited for you guys!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don&#039;t know why comments are off on your other blog (erm, well, probably b/c you don&#039;t want input? yeah, well, too bad, it&#039;s late, and I&#039;m wired, sorry) - I love and appreciate the perspective checks we received on a regular basis while working on this house. They will stick with you, and come back to you at the most interesting times. When the temps drop below freezing, and you find yourself able, once again, to pad to the bathroom barefooted, you&#039;ll smile. You&#039;ll smile at a lot of things. And do some things differently, for the rest of your lives, too. It&#039;s such a good, good life you&#039;re building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, all done rambling. Off to get caught up w/ Amber, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTG on the home, guys! ~Dy&lt;/p&gt;
