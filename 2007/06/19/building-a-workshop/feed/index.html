		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much. I&#039;m enjoying the process and it&#039;s very satisfying to be creating a structure (however simple) from just a bunch of wood and nails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the moments requiring bad words are very brief and quickly forgotten in the euphoria of coming up with a solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s all about taking the learning curve and remembering that the view from the top is going to be phenomenal!! You did a great job, you learned a lot (pretty much touched on everything Zorak and I thought of while we read) - and it looks great! (And you didn&#039;t even type bad words. Way to go!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep up the great work. This is terribly exciting. I&#039;m so tickled for you guys!
