		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Not many, from what I can tell. But it does look great - LOL&#039;d at the post. It&#039;s a lot more difficult than it sounds when it&#039;s just an idea. I love the screwdriver, though - that&#039;s just good, quick thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@amber - Yeah, the people going by must have thought that it was pretty weird - I kept my head down most of the time and just focused on digging. There was this one car in particular I remember, some guy leaned his head out the window as it flew by and yelled &quot;Hi Matt!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Jonathan - Yeah, they&#039;re leaning a bit, but I have to wonder how ours will look in a few years. I also wonder how many mailboxes posts are installed with the help of a level...&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh, but it stands so tall and proud!  :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, you know I appreciate your efforts.  I do rather wonder what the people thought who were driving by though...  &lt;em&gt;grin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
