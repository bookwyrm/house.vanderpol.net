		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi Matt and Amber - &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just found this site from Amber&#039;s blog, and now I&#039;m hooked. In fact, you guys have got me thinking about this whole building your own house thing. I would love to do something like that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take post requests, I would love to hear more about:
-  what made you guys decide to go this route
- what the cost difference is (on a percentage basis) than buying a pre-made house
- is this your full-time job or do you do this in your spare time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;d never even thought of doing something like this but it&#039;s a wonderful idea! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&quot;Your comment is awaiting moderation&quot;?
Should I tone it down? Should I check spelling?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Matt,
I just read your April 18 note on building kitchens.
I built all the cabinets for the McLean house (1958-1959) and wanted a smooth exterior, no knobs, natural finish and easy construction.
All of the cabinets, upper and lower, were hung from the wall using a mounting strip. I had a top strip, exterior front, above the door tops so the top of the cabinet was closed to the ceiling. The panels (doors) were all 3/4&quot; mahogany plywood and opened by reaching the slight lip on the bottom of the top cabinets and the slight lip on the tops of the lower cabinet panel fronts.  Hidden hinges. Clear satin finish. When I last visited the house, 40 years after installation the cabinets were still in place and looked good.
GD&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;If it helps any, I&#039;d recommend trying to see some cork samples in person. The ones on that link all look like something from my 9th grade Biology notebook. &lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt; But the sample we got to bring home with us has a very &quot;French Provincial&quot; look to it - sort of demands thick crockery and a stone hearth to go with it.  But, it looks equally nice with stainless and marble or corian.
I heard quite a lot about the marmoleum about two years ago, but only from the folks pushing it, and then &lt;em&gt;poof&lt;/em&gt; haven&#039;t heard much since then. If you go with that, you&#039;ll have to share the skinny on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FUN!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dy&lt;/p&gt;
