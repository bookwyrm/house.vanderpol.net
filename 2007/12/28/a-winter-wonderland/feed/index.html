		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks, very much. We should have the exterior finished sometime in the next couple weeks and we&#039;ll post more pictures when it&#039;s done. Granted, there likely won&#039;t be any snow on the ground but I think it&#039;ll still look good.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Wow!  I haven&#039;t checked in awhile and I am so proud of both of you!  This  was such an undertaking from the beginning and I must say that everything is turning out quite lovely.  I am so happy your family is so much closer to living in your &quot;forever home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
