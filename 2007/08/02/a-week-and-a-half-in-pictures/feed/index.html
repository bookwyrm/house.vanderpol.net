		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh, absolutely beautiful! I love it. Where&#039;d you get those big kids for the photo shoot, though? That can&#039;t be Gregory and Emma... it can&#039;t be. &lt;em&gt;sigh&lt;/em&gt; It is? Wow. They&#039;re getting big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And... is it really cool enough at any point in the day to put a child in a fleece pullover? Oh, the envy! It&#039;s so hot here, we contemplate the humanity in even making the kids wear shirts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m so glad you&#039;re taking photos and documenting this. In ten years, you&#039;ll look at them, then up at the kids, then back at the pictures, and think, &quot;You... were... soooooo... small... &lt;em&gt;sniff&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Hi, Amber and co!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WoW!  You guys are ambitious.  And wonderful.  I love the way your campsite already has your stamp on it.  The bed platform is particularly fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO glad to know you are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meg (from LMC book group)&lt;/p&gt;
