		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s really rather strange to think about, actually...  I think we&#039;ll feel a little lost!  But I&#039;m looking forward to it all the same.  It will be nice to be able to save some money again and spend money on things other than food and the house.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;I think once you manage to get into the house, you&#039;re going to wonder to do with all the spare time and money you&#039;ll have!  Won&#039;t that be fun?&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;LOL - well, at least I can take comfort in the fact that the list of things we have done is many, many, many times longer than this list.  But boy, I would not wish this process on anyone...  and I think I would try to dissuade anyone from following this route, especially if they have small children!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I very seldom actually think about living in the house.  Instead it seems like some sort of bizarre hobby that takes up all available time and money.  I think when we do live there it will seem really strange for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
