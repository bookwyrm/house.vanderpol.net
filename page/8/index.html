		<p>Since our house is a SIP house, it&#8217;s some extra work to put plugs and switches in the exterior walls. There will be times when it&#8217;s unavoidable, but we&#8217;re trying to minimize the situation both because it will be easier and we don&#8217;t want to pierce the envelop of the walls if we can avoid it.</p>
<p>One area in particular where we have to deal with this is in the kitchen. Kitchen&#8217;s require more plugs than any other room and it&#8217;s just plain convenient to have lots of plugs there. In order to make our electrical job easier, we&#8217;re furring out a 2&#215;4 wall just inside the SIP wall. This will also give us a place to run some water and gas supply lines into the kitchen.</p>
<p>This is what I worked on yesterday. [<a href="#kitchen-wall-note-1">1</a>]</p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/kitchen-wallimg-1953.jpg" height="300" width="400" border="0" alt="IMG_1953.jpg" /><span class="caption">This is the &#8220;before&#8221; shot. Notice that the wall in the shot (the east wall) is entirely OSB and the flooring in the back of the shot meets the OSB at the top of the wall.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/kitchen-wallimg-1964.jpg" height="300" width="400" border="0" alt="IMG_1964.jpg" /><span class="caption">Here is the &#8220;after&#8221; shot. It&#8217;s not done as I still need to frame around the window and finish building the corner but it&#8217;s looking good.</span></p>
<p>The studs are kind of hard to see, but they&#8217;re there. I put them on 24&#8243; centers and we&#8217;ll just put a plug on each stud to get our spacing pattern. It&#8217;s 2 different sections of bottom plate &#8211; they break around the conduit embedded in the slab to feed water and electrical to a possible future island.</p>
<p>If you look at the top, you can see that the flooring no longer (visibly) meets the OSB. We had some leftover appearance grade 4&#215;8 lumber when we built the house (determining lumber quantity must get easier with experience) so we decided to use it to make that wall more interesting after seeing an example in a picture of another house. It&#8217;s installed about 1 1/2&#8243; off of the SIP wall which will give us about an inch of reveal past the drywall.</p>
<p>I was working by myself and had some pretty tight clearances so I didn&#8217;t want to have to stand the wall after building it on the floor so I built it in place. First I cut and nailed up the 4&#215;8&#8217;s to keep them in place. Then I cut and nailed my upper top plate. The upper top plate is nailed to the SIP wall (which has a 6&#215;6 post in it) on the right and to the glu-lam beam on the left. It&#8217;s nailed up to each 4&#215;8 joist running perpendicular to the wall and to each decorative 4&#215;8 chunk parallel to the wall. This ties everything together solidly and nothing has any space to move. Originally I&#8217;d planned to use right angle brackets to hold the decorative 4&#215;8 chunks in place but I found it almost impossible to get them nailed in (you ever tried holding a nail and swinging a hammer a few inches up inside of a 1 1/2&#8243; wide space?).</p>
<p>Once I had the upper top plate up, I cut the lower top plate and the bottom plates (bottom plates are pressure treated) and marked them for stud locations. I then nailed the lower top place up and just placed the bottom plate where it&#8217;s supposed to go. Once I had that to work from I began measuring and cutting studs to go between them. I found there to be about a 3/16&#8243; variance in stud length, probably due to some unevenness in the concrete finishing around the embedded conduit.</p>
<p>After I had about 9 studs cut (enough to get even pressure from top plate onto bottom plate) I glued the bottom plates down with subfloor glue and began nailing the studs in place. After the studs were nailed up, I then nailed right angle brackets onto the studs and then into the SIP wall to help hold the wall in place. Probably this was overkill, but it makes me feel better and I&#8217;m sure that the inspector will appreciate it.</p>
<p>This weekend, I plan to finish the wall in addition to more work on waste line plumbing and starting on supply line plumbing.</p>
<p>[<a title="kitchen-wall-note-1" name="kitchen-wall-note-1"></a>1] I know it was a workday &#8211; I went out to the property in the morning to meet with someone about some plumbing questions and to borrow PEX tools. It was an absolutely beautiful day and I decided to call my boss and see if I could take an unplanned day off to work on the house. He was very accommodating.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;re well on our way on the next phase of house building &#8211; Drain, Waste, Vent plumbing. The last month or so, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of thinking and planning and the last couple of weeks have been busy executing, modifying and adapting the plan.I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve now finished all 3&#8243; waste lines. This means that the main waste stack is finished, toilet lines are in and all underfloor plumbing for the second story meets up with the main waste stack. I started out with about 5 feet of 3&#8243; ABS pipe left over from slab plumbing and bought another 20 foot length when I started interior work. I now have only a 3 inch and a 2 3/4 inch piece of 3&#8243; pipe left. Unfortunately, I also have a handful of 3&#8243; fittings left over from various plan modifications but I figure that that&#8217;s just the way things are.I&#8217;m doing all my plumbing in 2&#8243; and 3&#8243; lines so that we don&#8217;t have any issues with clogs. We&#8217;ve had issues with previous places and I&#8217;m doing everything I can to avoid it here &#8211; one of which is to keep things big.Here&#8217;s the current state of things.<img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1935.jpg" height="300" width="400" border="0" alt="IMG_1935.jpg" /><span class="caption">This is what I completed last weekend, but never got around to blogging about. The p-trap in the back left is for the master shower, the combo along that same line to the right is the vent for that line. The pipe that disappears into the left front corner behind the beam is for the master toilet. The combo in that line is its vent. The wye fitting which sends a pipe off at 45° from the toilet line is to bring in the sink drain from the master sink.</span><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1938.jpg" height="300" width="400" border="0" alt="IMG_1938.jpg" /><span class="caption">The same pipes, but from a different angle. Now you can see the line for the master toilet (back left) and the sink drain (just in front of it). We&#8217;ll have to soffit this space to hide the plumbing. It&#8217;s unfortunate to hide the beams and floor but we&#8217;ll gain a raceway for electrical lines. I knew from early on that we&#8217;d have to soffit here and I considered if it was worth using TJI&#8217;s 2 ft on center rather than the 4&#215;8 joists on a 4 ft center. Given how the plumbing worked out, I&#8217;m glad I stayed with the 4&#215;8&#8217;s because it gave me a much bigger box to work within and I didn&#8217;t need to worry about cutting through joists in this space. If you look closely, you can see my chalk and pencil lines on the underside of the floor. These helped me keep my pipes lined up and at the correct angles.</span><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1948.jpg" height="533" width="399" border="0" alt="IMG_1948.jpg" /><span class="caption">The single 3&#8243; pipe that leaves the bay in the previous photo goes through some blocking that keeps our joists from rolling and enters a bay over the downstairs bathroom. The wye in the middle of the picture is where we pick up the drain from the sinks in the kid&#8217;s bathroom. We make a 90° turn and enter the main waste stack towards the back of the picture. The other horizontal 3&#8243; pipe in the picture runs out to the right to the toilet in the kid&#8217;s bathroom. The master bathroom waste line joins the main stack with a 3&#8243; san-tee with a 3&#8243;-2&#8243; bushing so I can continue the vent straight up.</span><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1947.jpg" height="533" width="399" border="0" alt="IMG_1947.jpg" /><span class="caption">Here&#8217;s another shot of that juncture where it&#8217;s more clear what&#8217;s going on. The master bath waste line is coming in from the left. I&#8217;ve got a 3&#8243; san-tee going into a 3&#8243; combo which runs up to a 90° elbow to send the waste line to the toilet in the kid&#8217;s bathroom. The other side of the 3&#8243; combo has a 3&#8243;-2&#8243; bushing in it and I&#8217;ll pick up the drain from the kid&#8217;s bath there.</span><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1946.jpg" height="399" width="533" border="0" alt="IMG_1946.jpg" /><span class="caption">This is the kid&#8217;s toilet connection. I&#8217;m using a 332 wye with a 45° fitting to run the vent back and behind the toilet. I built a 6&#8243; plumbing wall there that we will put the vent in before running it out the roof.</span><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/dwv-plumbingimg-1950.jpg" height="533" width="399" border="0" alt="IMG_1950.jpg" /><span class="caption">Here&#8217;s the base of the main waste stack. There&#8217;s a 4&#8243; pipe coming out of the slab. I&#8217;ve got a 442 san-tee going right for the washer drain. Inside that is a 4&#8243;-3&#8243; bushing so that I can switch to 3&#8243; pipe for my main stack. Then I&#8217;ve got a 332 san-tee going left for the bathroom and laundry sinks. I may have to run those drains as 1 1/2&#8243; instead of 2&#8243; so that I end up with my drains at the right elevation. I&#8217;ll measure fitting sizes and see what fits. In the foreground is our drain line for the downstairs toilet (still sticking up where we had it when we poured concrete) and the little 90° elbow between the 4&#8243; pipe and the stud on the left is the vent for the toilet. Originally, I was going to run that vent straight up in the same stud bay as the wast stack, but there wouldn&#8217;t have been any room to get it past the 332 san-tee for the bathroom and laundry sinks. Moving it over to run up this other bay gives me the space I need to let the pipes pass each other.</span>I still need to put together the washer drain line and the downstairs sink lines, the downstairs shower drain and vent which I didn&#8217;t take pictures of, plus a bunch of vent stuff upstairs and the kid&#8217;s bath. All-in-all it&#8217;s going well. It&#8217;s definitely more difficult than I imagined it would be, but I feel like I have the tools now to really do the work. Some of those tools are pretty much what you&#8217;d expect but I was surprised at the need for others. I&#8217;ll write a follow up post talking about tools.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve been spending a bit of time walking around the house, looking at the bare, framed walls and imagining how out stuff will fit into it. Thinking about how we&#8217;ll be using the space. Considering if it&#8217;s all &#8220;right&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have come to the realization that the master isn&#8217;t quite right for our bed. Amber and I bought a really nice (for us) oak, platform-style bed with attached nightstands and built in storage where the header usually is back when we moved into our first house in Felton (before Emma was born). The smallest square that will box the bed is about 8&#8242; on a side. Our master bedroom is about 10&#8242; deep (from the exterior wall to the bathroom wall).</p>
<p>This leaves us only about 2&#8242; to walk around the bed and we just didn&#8217;t feel like it would be enough room.</p>
<p>After thinking about it individually, we each came to the decision that it really made sense to move the wall and make more space &#8211; and it&#8217;ll never be easier to move the wall than it is right now. It was a bit of a pleasant surprise for each of us to raise what we expected to be somewhat of a discussion point only to find out that we shared the view.</p>
<p>My dad and I started moving the wall about 1.5 weeks ago and it&#8217;s almost totally done now.</p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-moveimg-1752.jpg" alt="IMG_1752.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><span class="caption">This is the best &#8220;before&#8221; shot I can find. It shows the wall between the master and the master bath.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-moveimg-1836.jpg" alt="IMG_1836.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><span class="caption">The &#8220;close&#8221; wall is the original one and the far one is the new one. We kept the door where it was and just jogged the wall back 1&#8242; on a 45&deg; angle to make the math and cuts easier.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-moveimg-1840.jpg" alt="IMG_1840.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><span class="caption">Looking up at the top plates. Since we have storage space on top of the bathroom, we&#8217;ll have to cut joists and the OSB flooring to match our new wall path.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-moveimg-1865.jpg" alt="IMG_1865.jpg" border="0" width="360" height="479" /><span class="caption">Here is the almost finished wall. You can see that the new one is built, rim joist is moved, OSB is fixed and the old wall has been ripped down. In this shot the corner near the door isn&#8217;t totally finished, but I&#8217;ve finished it since I took the picture.</span></p>
<p><img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wall-moveimg-1866.jpg" alt="IMG_1866.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><span class="caption">Another perspective &#8211; looking down at it.</span></p>
<p>All in all, it wasn&#8217;t a very difficult task. Pretty much just straightforward carpentry. We had to think a bit to make sure we cut things right and we removed OSB in such a way that we could trim the joists, cut the OSB down and re-attach it.</p>
<p>We drew an outline of the bed on the floor using a lumber crayon while we were trying to decide if we had enough space and walking around the &#8220;bed&#8221; is now much more comfortable. I think that we made a good decision and will be very happy with the results.</p>

		<p>I feel like the month of January was mostly a time for catching our breath and figuring out what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>The structure is totally up (walls and roof). Most internal framing is done. The roof material is on and most of the siding, trim and fascia are done. External doors are hung, windows are in and we&#8217;re totally dried in.</p>
<p>Next comes plumbing and electrical. We&#8217;ve been planning our electrical setup and the DWV lines that we&#8217;ll need to run and the implementation of these plans should start in earnest this month.</p>

		<p>As many of you know, we brought Joc (pronounced &#8220;joss&#8221;, short for Jocelyn) into our lives back in August.<img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/dog-houseimg-1303.jpg" height="640" width="480" border="0" alt="IMG_1303.jpg" /></p>
<p>Since that time she&#8217;s lived in the tent or the trailer with us. When we moved into town, she stayed on the property and for a while we were going up there mornings to let her out of the trailer and feed her and evenings to put her back in the trailer and feed her.</p>
<p>This worked, but it wasn&#8217;t really an optimal solution &#8211; especially when the heater stopped working due to a blown fuse.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been meaning to build her a dog house for a while, but hadn&#8217;t really made time for it so I decided it was finally time.</p>
<p>I planned out a basic structure 48&#8243; wide, 64&#8243;long with 30 1/2&#8243; high walls <sup>1</sup> and a 5 in 12 pitch roof. The dimensions are all external and are designed to give me a good, clean 16&#8243; on center layout for studs and sheeting. I had left over 2&#215;6&#8217;s from the house framing so I built it with those. It gives inside dimensions of approximately 37&#8243;x55&#8243; (which turned out to be a bigger space than I&#8217;d realized it would).I bought materials (wall and roof sheeting, insulation, extra lumber for ridge beam and fascia, and treated wood for the floor joists) and built the floor, walls and rafters in one day.</p>
<p>The floor is pressure treated 2&#215;6&#8217;s with rim joists running the long way and joists on 16&#8243; centers with 3/4 OSB on top.The long walls are tied to the short walls with overlapping top plates and I used 2 stud corners so that I could get insulation in and use less wood. I framed an 18&#8243; wide by 24&#8243; high opening and used a left over piece of 4&#215;6 as a header.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a 24&#8243; overhang in front, over the opening, and an 8&#8243; overhang in back. The other overhangs are pretty small &#8211; mainly just to keep the water from dripping down the walls which are sheeted with 3/8 OSB.The rafters are at a 5 in 12 pitch and butt up against a ridge beam The ridge beam is supported by a single 2&#215;6 stud on each side to help keep the ridge from dropping and provide a nailing space for my gable sheeting. The ceiling is a cathedral style (following the underside of the roof &#8211; not flat) and the roof sheeting is 5/8 OSB.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s a pretty basic structure, I decided to build it with barge rafters, lookouts and a real fascia because it&#8217;s a technique I didn&#8217;t use on my workshop. All in all it worked well. I feel capable of doing it that way again on a bigger structure. I still find it pretty amazing how much I&#8217;ve learned about framing in the last 8 months or so.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s insulated with R-19 fiberglass insulation and we&#8217;ll get a vinyl door to help seal it.Right now, it&#8217;s just got tar paper on the roof for water proofing. Once the snow melts and the roof dries out I&#8217;ll be able to put shingles on. Since each side isn&#8217;t very big (only about 30&#8243; by 96&#8243;) I was able to use full sheets and there&#8217;s only a small opening at the ridge.</p>

The large overhang in front should help to keep the entry dry and provide somewhat of a shady spot in the summer.</span></p>

<hr />
<p>[1] Since I&#8217;ve got a 24&#8243; tall opening, a 3 1/2&#8243; high header and a double top plate, building a 30 1/2&#8243; wall means I don&#8217;t have to put any top cripples in above the header.</p>

		<p>Last night, we got our first &#8220;real&#8221; snowfall. I don&#8217;t think that what we got before counted as real, it was more of a &#8220;practice&#8221; session. We got snow both at our apartment and at the house.</p>

<p>The last few weeks have just been a flurry of activity on the house. All the walls are up, the roof panels are on, and the interior rough framing will be finished in the next couple days.</p>
<p>Once that&#8217;s all done (and inspected) we&#8217;re moving on to roofing and siding. We&#8217;ve got two different outfits lined up for those and after the work is done, we&#8217;ll be completely weather-tight! The can snow, storm and shed water as much as it wants and we can continue to work happily inside.</p>
<p>The inside work will initially consist of electrical, plumbing and planning. Plumbing will be fairly straightforward but we&#8217;ll have to figure out a few odd places and how to route pipes so that they&#8217;ll have the correct fall with minimal disruption to the structural elements. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have to build some soffits to hide things but that&#8217;s just part of the project.</p>
<p>Electrical work will be a challenge because we&#8217;ve got a lot of exposed ceiling and routing wires will be a challenge. I&#8217;ve got a brother who&#8217;s a commercial electrician up in Alaska and he&#8217;s going to come down and help us out for a week or so this spring. Before he comes though, we need to have everything planned and prepped as much as possible so that he can just work on what he&#8217;s good at &#8211; running wire and hooking things up correctly. I&#8217;m sure that he wouldn&#8217;t mind helping out with some construction-esque work to route the wires but there are reasons that he&#8217;s a commercial electrician, not a residential electrician.</p>
<p>Once all the walls are up and the space is clean and dry, we can also start planning the kitchen layout, figuring out how our flooring will be arranged and thinking about what sort of railing we&#8217;ll using on our numerous edges. The pace of work will slow down considerably but it will be more directly driven and handled just by us &#8211; a change we&#8217;re definitely looking forward to. It&#8217;s been nice (and necessary) to hire some outside help to get us to this point but I&#8217;m looking forward to getting back to our original intent of doing it ourselves.</p>

		<p>We had our first snowfall that we&#8217;ve seen on the property this week! It&#8217;s very exciting to be finally living in a place where it snows.</p>
<p>Driving up to the property on Monday morning, it really felt like winter was here as I saw small mounds of snow on the side of the road and the deep green of the evergreens was softened by a little dusting of white.</p>

		<p>So, I&#8217;m finally back &#8211; after a month of focus on the house. As you all read in Amber&#8217;s previous post(s) we&#8217;ve hired some people to help us put the house up. I had originally intended to start putting the house up just by myself and with family during November&#8230;that didn&#8217;t happen. We did get a few panels up over the Thanksgiving weekend, but it&#8217;s just too big of a job for weekends. We&#8217;d be at it for months and I shudder to think what the winter weather would do to it all.</p>
<p>So, since we hired some people, our first story walls are up, interior walls are framed, posts and beams are set (a big job), first story windows are in and work has commenced on the second story floor. I spent a week working with them then I had to go back to work.</p>
<p>Check out the mast and the pictures below to see how we&#8217;re progressing.</p>
<p>
<img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/posts-beams-wall-floorimg-1670.jpg" alt="South Face" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><br />
The south wall with the sun shining on it. From the right the openings are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kitchen window, over the sink</li>
<li>Dining room window</li>
<li>Picture windows flanking a sliding glass door in the open area</li>
<li>Windows on either side of where our woodstove will be in the hearth room</li>
</ol>
<p>
<img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/posts-beams-wall-floorimg-1683.jpg" alt="IMG_1683.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><br />
Both Amber and I are fans of wood. We&#8217;re going to have a lot of exposed beams and some posts in the house. The GluLam in the foreground running out to the left goes out into the kitchen/dining room area. The GluLam parallel to and behind it delineates the boundary between dining room and open area. The post where the beams join is an 8&#215;8 monster and I&#8217;m glad we didn&#8217;t go with something smaller. It looks like the perfect size for the area. The staggered windows on the left in the back will follow the stairs up.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://house.vanderpol.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/posts-beams-wall-floorimg-1686.jpg" alt="IMG_1686.jpg" border="0" width="479" height="360" /><br />
Instead of the usual OSB subfloor, we&#8217;re going with a tongue and groove 2&#215;6 fir. This will be exposed on the bottom in much of the downstairs and will be our floor upstairs until we put a finish floor down. The big GluLam through the center of the shot separates the kitchen/dining area from a hallway of sorts. The GluLam running out to the left is the same one from before that goes out into the kitchen/dining area. I was standing in our side door when I took the shot. We&#8217;re really excited by how the flooring looks and it&#8217;s turning out just like we hoped it would.
</p>
<p>

One of the coolest things about a floor like this is character. We get nice clean pieces, knotty pieces and stuff like this.</p>
