		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Dy. One reason we&#039;re moving fast is that we&#039;re hiring people to do some of the work for us - a trade off of time vs money. The state of CA is pretty particular about the state of a building before you can move in so we&#039;re trying to balance doing the work ourselves vs being able to move into it in a reasonable time frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re at the point now where I think that we&#039;ve hired out almost everything we&#039;re going to (except maybe drywall) and we&#039;ve already slowed down as we plan electrical and plumbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joss definitely likes her dog house and I&#039;ve been ribbed by several people in my family that it&#039;s the &quot;nicest dog house in the area&quot; and that it will &quot;stand up to any snow load we can reasonably expect to have here&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Oh. Wow. I can&#039;t believe the progress since the last time I came to check in on you guys!!! That first shot of the snowfall, looking down the drive - hey, it&#039;s a HOUSE! It&#039;s a gorgeous house, too! WOOHOO! You guys are making great time, and putting us to shame. But we&#039;re so very happy for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bet the dog loves the new digs, too. That&#039;s one swanky doghouse, there! ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
