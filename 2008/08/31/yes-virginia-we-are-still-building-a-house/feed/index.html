		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Yes, I decided that it was a good time to start posting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always knew that it was a big undertaking, but it&#039;s turning out to be a bit bigger than I expected. It&#039;s not that anything is all that difficult (except maybe plumbing) but it there&#039;s a lot to do and it all takes time - especially when you don&#039;t do it as a profession and you need to figure stuff out as you go along.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Wow, Matt!  When you list it all out, you realize how much you have done.  Although I&#039;m sure it feels slow, your house IS getting built!  And all the while you continue to be a super dad and husband.  Well done.&lt;/p&gt;
