		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Laura. You&#039;re welcome to use the photos in your class but please keep in mind that I&#039;m not a licensed plumber, just an ambitious owner builder and the photos should be used for general reference only. I built to code but code may be different where you are. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Great plumbing! I was looking on the web for plumbing images that show multiple fixture drains  to use in a class I&#039;m teaching and found these. I was wondering if it would be okay to use them (with credit to the site).
thanks,
Laura&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Mike. Since we&#039;re building on a slab and don&#039;t have any attic area there&#039;s really no place to put a cleanout that will be accessible (unless we incorporate it into the wall design). I&#039;d much rather pull the toilet than have to cut drywall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our plumbing is very concentrated in one corner of the house and our particular design doesn&#039;t allow space for future expansion. Any remodeling like that will need to be fairly extensive and we&#039;d simply fold plumbing changes in with everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your comments on the pictures and work.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;This is just my opinion, but I believe in putting a cleanout on most areas of your plumbing.  The parts are cheap, and it is much easier to simply unscrew a threaded plug to clean out the lines than to &quot;pull a toilet&quot;.  Seal the threaded plug with pipe dope compound to make it easier to unscrew and to better seal out sewer gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason to put a clean out, at least for me, is to continue a run for a short distance, then put a clean-out, so that if you need future expansion, you simply cut the clean-out off, with enough straight pipe on each side of the cut to re-use the pieces at least one more time, extend the run with a coupling to connect the new and old pipe, then glue the old cleanout back on the new end of the run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like good work and good pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a comment on California, I hate when governments make you completely finish a building before being able to use it.  It&#039;s your property, your money to build the property, and it would save you a large amount of time and money if you were able to live where you work instead of driving home every day to another location.  More regulation always helps.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;@Amber - Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@Dy - As far as I know, I don&#039;t need clean-outs in the lines that you see here. I&#039;ll probably put in a clean-out somewhere in the 2nd story where the 2&quot; vent continues up from the main waste stack. We do have 3 different clean-outs outside that run to the pipes in the slab and we can always pull a toilet and run a clean-out from there. Also, since the smallest waste lines are 2&quot;, I really don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever have problems with clogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don&#039;t know how long it&#039;ll take me to do the rest of the work, I&#039;m giving out a move-in date of Christmas 2008. In California (at least Nevada County) we pretty much have to be &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; in order to move in. All bathrooms finished, all drywall up, kitchen complete, etc. Unfortunately, we can&#039;t just finish a part of the house and live there while working on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;Wow, that&#039;s a fantastic post! I like the way you&#039;ve put it together, AND managed to photograph it. :-) Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there no clean-outs in there? I didn&#039;t know if you&#039;d opted not to put them in, or if you just didn&#039;t want to put them there, where they&#039;ll have soffits over them. (And who knew there were SO many choices about how to run pipe, huh? Although it&#039;s pretty fascinating and kind of fun once you get started.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s looking so great. SO great. Do you have an ETA on getting a cert. of occupancy? (Is that what they&#039;re called in CA? The little paper that says you can move in now.)&lt;/p&gt;
