		<description><![CDATA[&lt;p&gt;You wrote this so well, I had flashbacks. :-) Don&#039;t be hard on yourself when things take longer than you think they should - the learning curve is steep, sometimes. But in the end, the knowledge you will have accumulated is astounding! And, hey, YAY for you on thinking to double-check your crimps. Our Wonderful Neighbors in MD had to replace a huge portion of their ceiling in their living room b/c the contractors (licensed contractors!!) who built their townhouse weren&#039;t so thorough in the upstairs bathroom. That wasn&#039;t pretty!&lt;/p&gt;
